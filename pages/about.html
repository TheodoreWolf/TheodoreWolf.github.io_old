                    <p>Hello, I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a background in Physics and Chemistry.
                        I am very interested in applications of ML to science, particularly to the problem of climate
                        change. <br>
                        <br>
                        I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://carbonre.com/"

                <h5>Carbon Re, 2022-Present</h5>
                <p>Working on a variety of projects, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>I was tasked with making ML models based on high dimensional industrial time series.
                        Most of the focus is on cement data which involves complex physical interactions. </li>

                    <li>The work also involves maintaining a complex production environment. The pipeline consists of
                        many steps:
                        requesting live data from an API or MQTT (depending on the client),
                        preprocessing the data with AWS lambdas, storing it in AWS timestream.
                        This data is then fed to the inference service which loads ML models from WandB and sends the
                        results to the online web-platform for the clients to view. </li>
                </ul>

                <h5>University College London, 2021-2022</h5>
                <p>Studied a wide variety of topics including
                    NLP, RL, Bayesian Deep Learning, Variational inference.
                    My dissertation was about using RL in Integrated Assessment Models, work that I then published at <a

                <h3>BSc Astrophysics and Physical Chemistry</h3>
                <h5> University College London, 2018-2021</h5>
                <p>Starting from the BSc Natural Sciences, I specialised over time into Astrophysics and Physical
                    Chemistry.
                    Got to learn MatLab and some really interesting stuff about the large and small scales of our
                    universe.
                    Did you know that there is 6 times more dark matter than regular matter, and yet we've never
                    directly detected it?
