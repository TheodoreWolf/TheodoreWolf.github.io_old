                <h3>Solving an Integrated Assesment Model with
                    reinforcement learning</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of my Masters at UCL, I worked on using Reinforcement Learning in an Integrated
                    Assessment model. This was very novel work and there was very little prior work to base my work on. 
                    <br><br>
                    It was a hugely challenging project, but I learned a lot about RL and the problems in applying it to dynamical systems.
                    Notably, I wrote my own implementations of A2C, PPO, DQN, Double DQN (with duelling nets + PER buffer) in Pytorch. 
                    I subsequently published my work at the workshop "Tackling Climate Change with AI" at NeurIPS 2023.
