                <h3>Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Pytorch</h3>
                <p>Wrote a Medium article about implementing PINNs with Pytorch. You can find the article <a

                <h3>Implementing Gaussian Processes with NumPy</h3>
                Wrote an implementations of Gaussian Processes from scratch with just Numpy.
                You can find the code <a href="https://github.com/TheodoreWolf/gps_numpy">here</a>
                and the TowardsDataScience article I wrote as an explanation <a
